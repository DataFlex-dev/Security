# Security Library 

---

Data Access Worldwide created the DataFlex Security Library. With this library attached to your application workspace you can create and verify hashes, store passcodes securely, add 2-factor authentication to your web application, and use encryption. This library provides access to some of todayâ€™s most popular and secure algorithms.

The installer executable that you can download installs up to three library workspaces. The main library provides only a framework, which ensures that every security engine will be accessible using a single, easy to use API. This workspace also contains a manual (PDF) to help you get started.

The additional libraries provide access to CNG (CryptoAPI Next Generation) and libsodium. CNG is a part of Windows itself. Libsodium requires distribution of the dll, as well as (potentially) installation of the MS Visual C++ Runtime 2017.

## Algorithms
The current version supports the following algorithms:

- Generic hashes: MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2 (256, 384, 512), blake2b
- Keyed hashes: HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-2 (256, 384, 512), HMAC-SHA512-256 (truncated SHA-512), blake2b
- Secure passcode storage: PBKDF2-SHA-1, PBKDF2-SHA-256, scrypt, argon2i, argon2id
- Symmetric encryption: AES-CBC
- Authenticated encryption: AES-GCM
- 2FA: oATH TOTP/HOTP and FIDO U2F
