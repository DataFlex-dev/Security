The DataFlex Security library consists of multiple workspaces. The main workspace
contains a framework that provides a common API for accessing security engines.

The other workspaces each contain a library that exposes a specific security engine
to the framework. The engines currently supported are Microsoft's CryptoAPI Next
Generation (CNG), and the free and open source library libsodium.
